## 📋 Prerequisites

- Web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or any similar local development stack

## ⚙️ Installation

```

2. Move the files to your web server directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP)

## 🤔 How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to generate random scores for:
- Facial symmetry (0-99%)
- Feature balance (0-99%)
- Expression (0-99%)

These scores are then averaged to calculate an overall "handsomeness" score. Results are stored locally in the browser for history tracking.

**Note**: No real analysis or image processing occurs - this is purely for entertainment!
